lilb :: lblwp

A tiny static website written in Node.JS that serves up swag. The only reason this is written in Node.JS is so that it can be freely hosted on [heroku](heroku.com).

See [lblwp.org](http://www.lblwp.org) and [lblwp.net](http://www.lblwp.net) for maximum swag.

Inspired by [the original](http://www.imgur.com/LBLWP.gif).
